    <p><b>SUID</b></p>
    <p>Subunit ID. Concatenation of the Region, Forest, District, FACTS ID, and Subunit codes. The SUID identifies down to the subunit where an activity will occur within an Activity Unit. Activity Subunits can have multiple activities on them and overlap with other Subunits within the Activity Unit. SUID is alpha/numeric. SUID is one of the links between spatial and tabular data records.</p>
    <h3>NRM FACTS</h3>
    <div>
    <p>The activity subunit that corresponds to the land encompassing the whole of the activity unit must have a subunit ID of '000'. When activities are performed on only a portion of an activity unit, a new subunit can be created to represent that portion. These subunits may be numbered in sequential order or use letters that more easily identify the subunit. The subunit is identified in total by a concatenation of the AU (Activity Unit) Region, AU Proclaimed or Administrative Forest, AU District, FACTS ID, and Subunit fields. An example of a SUID is 0111021A51466541016. This first six numbers of this 19-digit code include the region/forest/district code (011102), followed by the ten-digit FACTS ID (1A51466541), and concluded with the three digit subunit (016).</p>

    <p><b>ACTIVITY_CODE</b></p>
    <p>The activity code is a 4-digit code that represents an activity. FACTS activity codes are numerically grouped into these categories: 1000 = Fire; 2000 = Range; 3000 = Cultural Resources and Recreation; 4000 = Timber and Silviculture; 5000 = Soil, Air and Watershed; 6000 = Wildlife; Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive, and Fisheries; 7000 = Vegetation/Restoration; 8000 = Miscellaneous; 9000 = Engineering.</p>

    <p>Two-aged Shelterwood Establishment Cut (w/res) - 2A (2 ages) / RH (regeneration harvest) / NFH (non final harvest): A type of establishment cut that removes trees except those needed for regeneration and sufficient residual trees representing at least approximately 10% of full stocking. Prepares the seed bed and creates a new age class in a moderated microenvironment. This establishment cut will be followed by the final harvest which will leave at least approximately 10% full stocking to create a two-aged stand. This activity code is in the Timber and Silviculture grouping.</p>

    <p>Two-aged Shelterwood Final Removal Cut (w/res) 2A (2 ages) / NRH (non regeneration harvest) / FH (final harvest): A final removal cut that releases established regeneration from competition with overwood after it is no longer needed for shelter under the shelterwood regeneration method. At least approximately 10% of full stocking is retained to attain goals other than regeneration and create a two-aged stand. This activity code is in the Timber and Silviculture grouping.</p>
